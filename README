Project inspired by music from Fuzznet.World -- goal is to turn a boring human DJ into something a bit more colorful and quite a bit more fuzzy.

Not responsible for literally anything so do whatever the heck you want with this. See also: Apple's clause about using itunes for nuclear proliferation.
